# .dotfiles

A selection of oddities to help with my own day to day. Used mostly on OSX / debian / arch. No guarantees

## volumes

It's worth noting that I've dedicated a directory on my machine to act as a home for all of my container volumes - for me this is `~/v/`. Tweak this to suit your needs (esp. in `.dockerfunc`)

## requirements

- Docker
- Vim (and Vundle)

## install

- (optional) `./requirements.sh` - installs a bunch of stuff, suitable for bootstrapping
- `make install`
